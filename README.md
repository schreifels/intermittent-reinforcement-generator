# Intermittent Reinforcement Generator

An extremely simple webpage which randomly determines whether you should administer a reward based on a target intermittent reinforcement percentage.

## Usage

https://schreifels.github.io/intermittent-reinforcement-generator/?pct=60

(This will result in a reward 60% of the time. Update the "60" in the URL to whatever value you like.)
