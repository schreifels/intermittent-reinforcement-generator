# Intermittent Reinforcement Generator

An extremely simple webpage which randomly determines whether you should administer a reward based on a target intermittent reinforcement percentage.

## Theory

> Intermittent reinforcement is the delivery of a reward at irregular intervals, a method that has been determined to yield the greatest effort from the subject. The subject does not receive a reward each time they perform a desired behavior or according to any regular schedule but at seemingly random intervals.

Dr. Andrew Huberman, a neuroscientist at the Stanford University School of Medicine, explains why and how you might use this in his podcast episode [How to Increase Motivation & Drive](https://youtu.be/vA50EK70whE?t=4405). He offers some additional practical advice in [this interview](https://youtu.be/31DMZLK_PPs?t=5356).
